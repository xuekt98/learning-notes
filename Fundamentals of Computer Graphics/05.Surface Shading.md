# Surface Shading

## 5.1 Point-like light sources

Point-like sources come in two flavors:

* a point source is small enough to be treated as a point, but is close to the scene and can illuminate different surfaces differently;

* a directional source is both small enough (relative
to its distance) to be treated as point-like and also so far away that it illuminates
all surfaces the same and there is no need to keep track of its location, only its direction. 

### 5.1.1 Point source illumination

A point source can be isotropic, meaning the intensity is the same in all directions.  

Spot lights only send light in some directions.
