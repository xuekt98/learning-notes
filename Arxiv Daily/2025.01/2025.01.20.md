Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive problem-solving abilities across a wide range of tasks and domains. However, their capacity for face understanding has not been systematically studied. To address this gap, we introduce FaceXBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs on complex face understanding tasks. FaceXBench includes 5,000 multimodal multiple-choice questions derived from 25 public datasets and a newly created dataset, FaceXAPI. These questions cover 14 tasks across 6 broad categories, assessing MLLMs' face understanding abilities in bias and fairness, face authentication, recognition, analysis, localization and tool retrieval.
