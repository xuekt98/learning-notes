Image matching, which aims to identify corresponding pixel locations between images, is crucial in a wide range of scientific disciplines, aiding in image registration, fusion, and analysis. We propose a large-scale pre-training framework that utilizes synthetic cross-modal training signals, incorporating diverse data from various sources, to train models to recognize and match fundamental structures across images.

Automatic target recognition (ATR) plays a critical role in tasks such as navigation and surveillance, where safety and accuracy are paramount. we propose a novel pipeline that combines the detection capabilities of open-world detectors with the recognition confidence of LVLMs, creating a robust system for zero-shot ATR of novel classes and unknown domains.

![img](res/2025.01.14/1-003.png)

 we propose a coarse - to - fine generation pipeline for regional prompt - following generation. Specifically, we first utilize the powerful large language model (LLM) to generate both high - level descriptions of the image (such as content, topic, and objects) and low - level descriptions (such as details and style). Then, we explore the influence of cross - attention layers at different depths. We find that deeper layers are always responsible for high - level content control, while shallow layers handle low - level content control.

We introduce PPD, a multi-reward optimization objective that aligns diffusion models with personalized preferences. With PPD, a diffusion model learns the individual preferences of a population of users in a few-shot way, enabling generalization to unseen users.

![img](res/2025.01.14/1-005.png)

We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted contiguous Gaussians.

In this paper, we address the challenge of generating temporally consistent videos with motion guidance. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that combines an initial-noise-based approach with a novel motion consistency loss, the latter being our key innovation. Specifically, we capture the inter-frame feature correlation patterns of intermediate features from a video diffusion model to represent the motion pattern of the reference video.

Video editing models have advanced significantly, but evaluating their performance remains challenging. We present SST-EM (Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal Evaluation Metric), a novel evaluation framework that leverages modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Object Detection, and Temporal Consistency checks.

Facial video editing has become increasingly important for content creators, enabling the manipulation of facial expressions and attributes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel facial video editing framework that leverages the rich latent space of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and fine-tune them specifically for facial video editing tasks.

![img](res/2025.01.14/4-001.png)

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven highly effective for enhancing complex reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Yet, it struggles in complex spatial reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, human cognition extends beyond language alone, enabling the remarkable capability to think in both words and images. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose a new reasoning paradigm, Multimodal Visualization-of-Thought (MVoT). It enables visual thinking in MLLMs by generating image visualizations of their reasoning traces.
